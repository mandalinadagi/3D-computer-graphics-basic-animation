# 3D-computer-graphics-basic-animation

- This animation contains some basic structures of OpenGL and combines them around a theme which is imaginazed by myself. 
- It is called journey of the snowlady.
- Whole animation has been created using only 3 main types of objects such as conic, circle and square. All components are combination of these 3 objects in different scales and colors.
- In this project there exits a snowlady, hellium ballon, clouds and sky as objects of interest.
