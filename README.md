# 3D-computer-graphics-basic-animation

- This animation contains some basic structures of OpenGL and combines them around an imaginary theme with different illumination techniques.
- It is called journey of the snowlady. The story of the project is a snowlady taking trip through out the whole day to reach her country. It starts from morning and ends at night.
- Whole animation has been created using only 3 main types of objects such as conic, circle and square. All components are combination of these 3 objects in different scales and colors.
- In this project there exits a snowlady, hellium ballon, clouds and sky as objects of interest. 
- Sometimes it is better to launch main.html file using firefox rather than google chrome.
